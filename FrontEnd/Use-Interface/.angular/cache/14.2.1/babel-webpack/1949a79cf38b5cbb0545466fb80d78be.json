An eBook (or Electronic Book) is a version of a printed book in digital format. They are cheaper and quicker to publish and therefore provide a more convenient way to circulate literature. During the 1970s the Internet provided a huge step forward for sharing digital texts and making them available on screen and ready to download. By the end of the 1990s, publishers started to provide digital versions alongside their printed counterparts. EBooks are typically read using an e-reader, such as the popular Kindle, although most digital devices can read EPUBs, the most common format used today. Some devices even allow you to listen to the spoken word and read at the same time. There are plenty of free eBooks available in the public domain, from sites such as Gutenberg and although not likely to replace printed books in the near future, eBooks and audio books are changing the way we consume literature. Digitalbook.io aims to facilitate this by bringing together the best digital books from all the top online sources.\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(7, \"footer\", 6)(8, \"cite\", 7);\n        i0.ɵɵtext(9, \"Digital Books Store India, 142 street Tel. 93 237 55 64 Opening hours: Monday to Thursday: 9am \\u2013 6pm \\u2013 Friday: 9am \\u2013 3pm\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd()()()()()();\n      }\n    },\n    styles: [\".font[_ngcontent-%COMP%]{color:#010713;background-image:url(https://w0.peakpx.com/wallpaper/972/48/HD-wallpaper-stack-of-books-blue-background-education-concepts-books-library-school-learning-concepts.jpg)}\"]\n  });\n  return AboutUsComponent;\n})();","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
